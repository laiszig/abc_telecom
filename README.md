### This project was done as part of the Simplilearn FSD Master Course.

Sporty Shoes is a company that manufactures and sells sports shoes. 
They have a walk-in store, and now, they wish to launch their e-commerce portal sportyshoes.com.
Youâ€™re asked to develop a prototype of the application. 
It will be then presented to the relevant stakeholders for budget approval.

### Features 
The system should be a web-based application, developed using spring framework as a backend and angular as a front-end that performs the following functions:
* Enables the Administrator to create and manages the lifecycle of different types of users
** Customer
** Manager
** Engineer
* Enables the customers to login to the portal to raise and track complaints related to the services availed by them
* Enables the manager to login, view the complaints raised by the customers and assign the ticket to the engineers based on the PIN Code
* Enables the engineers to pick up the tickets, work on them, enter the status of the task. They can also re-assign it to the Field Workers if they cannot resolve it from the data center.
