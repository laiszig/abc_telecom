### This project was done as part of the Simplilearn FSD Master Course.

ABC Telecom Ltd. is one of Indiaâ€™s major telecommunication service providers offering landline, mobile phone and Fiber optic broadband services across the country.
Their customer services group is interested in providing a set of customer redressal services through the development of a new application using the state-of-art technologies such as Spring-boot for the development of java-based services, and UI using Angular and integrate them suitably, so that all the necessary services are taken care of through this application. 
They want to have an online complaint management system where the customers can raise complaints regarding their landlines and broadband services.

### Features 
The system should be a web-based application, developed using spring framework as a backend and angular as a front-end that performs the following functions:
* Enables the Administrator to create and manages the lifecycle of different types of users: Customer, Manager and Engineer
* Enables the customers to login to the portal to raise and track complaints related to the services availed by them
* Enables the manager to login, view the complaints raised by the customers and assign the ticket to the engineers based on the PIN Code
* Enables the engineers to pick up the tickets, work on them, enter the status of the task. They can also re-assign it to the Field Workers if they cannot resolve it from the data center.
